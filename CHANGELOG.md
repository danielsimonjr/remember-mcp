## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **SQLite concurrency race in archive flow** (`remember/system.py`).
  `archive_old_memories` previously ran SELECT, the (slow) memvid encode,
  and DELETE/COMMIT across separate `asyncio.to_thread` calls on the
  shared SQLite connection, allowing concurrent `add_memory` to interleave
  and corrupt state. The DELETE + COMMIT now run inside a `with conn:`
  transaction block, and an `asyncio.Lock` on the system instance
  serializes archive/add paths.
- **MemvidRetriever per-query reinstantiation leak**
  (`remember/system.py`, `remember/file_indexer.py`). Retrievers were
  constructed fresh inside every search loop, reloading the FAISS index
  and reopening the mp4 reader on every call (file-handle leak + slow).
  Retrievers are now cached keyed by `(video_path, index_path)` on the
  system / indexer instance. Both classes expose a `close()` that drops
  the pool; `server.main()` now calls them in a `finally:` block on exit.
- **Bare `except: pass` in `RememberSystem.get_stats`**. Two stat-size
  loops swallowed every exception — including programming bugs and
  permission errors — making corrupted archive index entries impossible
  to debug. Now catches `OSError` specifically and logs via
  `logger.warning`.
